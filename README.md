## Using the generators

You can use the generators to make your life easier:

**New component**

If you're adding a new component, use `bin/rails generate example_view`. This generates a new component example view and a basic component.

e.g. `bin/rails generate example_view Menu Navigation`

This will create:

- app/views/examples/menus/show_view.rb
- app/views/components/examples/menus/basic_component.rb

It will also append the component in `components.yml` file under the "Navigation" section and restart the server.

**New example**

If you're adding a new example to an existing component, use `bin/rails generate example_component`. This generates a new component example.

e.g. `bin/rails generate example_component Cards::Responsive "Optional title"`

This will create:

- app/views/components/examples/cards/responsive_component.rb
